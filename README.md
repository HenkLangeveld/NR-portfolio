# NR-portfolio

This started out as an exercise to setup a portfolio
I was following a frontend development course at Noah Road in Utrecht. This was exercise 2.01 creating a portfolio in HTML.

Now I'm revisiting this site to show my progress in front-end development. Show my skills in (S)CSS especially in 3D and animations, show code snippets, which online courses i've followed, where I get inspiration from, etc. At this point i'm still working on integrating those new items.
